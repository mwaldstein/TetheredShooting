NOTES - 

Got the sessions all messed up - sessions that don't do anything don't stay
running, so they can't catch any signals. Need to re-work so sessions are only
alive when working. 

Two sessions remain running - 
* GTK2 ui
* Web ui

Signals needed -
* screen photo - to tell the local ui to redisplay
* cell photo - to tell the web server to redisplay
