| Tethered Shooting |
+-------------------+

TetheredShooting is a quick/dirty way to control a tethered camera +
view the output 'live' as photos are taken. It also has a web component
to allow for remote triggering, such as from a smart phone to allow
wireless triggering. 

Tethered shooting is written in perl using the POE framework with
sprinklings of Moose for good measure.
